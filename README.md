This is a community-driven resource to support hairdressers that offer gender neutral pricing and customers who require it. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices.

# User Goals
## External userâ€™s goal:
* Users want to find and recommend hairdressers(including salons, barbers, etc.) that do not question the gender of the customer.

## Site owner's goal:
* Provide support to customers who are inconvenienced by gendered pricing and highlight misogynistic pricing practices.
* Direct customers to businesses who are willing to provide non-gendered pricing in hairdressing services.

## Features to include:

## Known Bugs



# Deployment

## Create a Heroku App
Heroku is the service being used to host the app. It is possible to deploy using the  Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) but in this case automatic deployment via GitHub was chosen. The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps...

1. Log in to Heroku and create a new app (Fairdressers, located in Europe)
1. In the app page go to the deploy tab and choose Git Hub as the deployment method

1. Go into the Heroku app settings page and click to reveal config vars
 1. Enter the below key value pairs:
  * "IP" : "0.0.0.0"
  * "PORT" : "5000"
  * As well as the value for the secret key variable, which was named SECRET_KEY in thai example but can have been assigned any name
1. Set to automatically deploy
 1. Click 'deploy' tab and select 'github'
 1. Search for the repository name that matches the app and click 'connect'


## Create a requirements.txt File
Send the output of the freeze command into a file called requirements.txt. The file contains a list of dependencies such as werkzeug. Flask and jinja will have been installed by PIP but now requirements.txt allows Heroku to detect this app as a Python app
1. In the terminal enter: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt.
1. Add the newly created file to the git staging area (by using git add -A, for example)
1. Git commit the change

## Create a PROC file
This tells heroku how to run the application. Heroku can not see any git ignored files including env.py that contains the secret key.
1. To create the procfile type "echo web: python run.py > Procfile"
1. Check that there is no trailing white space in the file
1. Git add the file, commit and push

## Enable automatic deployment
 1. Go back to the deploy tab in the Heroku page
 1. Click to enable automatic deployment, leave the branch as 'main'
 1. At the bottom of the page, under the manual deployment section, choose the same branch again and click 'deploy branch'
 1. Heroku will now build the application with code from github, wait to see a message appear saying "Your app was successfully deployed".

# Credits
## Code
The main framework was inspired by the task manager project and the thorin project
Many of the javascript features came from materialize
All icons used came from google via materialize
The idea to alternate text and images on the about page came from the Thorin project
A standard 12 column fluid responsive grid system from Materialize was used as demonstrated in the Task project and adapted to shape the pages in horizontal stripes like the flag while keeping the site responsive 
The addition of a date field was adapted from code found at https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/current-datetime

## Content
All content was written by the developer.
The inspiration for the colour scheme can be found at https://outrightinternational.org/content/flags-lgbtiq-community
An alternative design consideration was the gender queer flag and the trans flag but, this site is not intended to serve those communities exclusively,  the focus on this site is the desired absence of gender consideration so the non-binary was most suitable.
The extensive use of black as a header was inspired by [Vice magazine](https://www.vice.com/en/section/tech), which is popular with the LGBT community and conveys a modern and alternative aesthetic.
